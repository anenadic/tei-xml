An introduction TEI XML for archivists, cataloguers and other library and information professionals.

This lesson is based on a series of three workshops delivered at The University of Manchester Library in November to December 2019.
Learners were given "homework" activities at the end of each workshop.
Some time was given at the start of the subsequqent workshop to discuss these activities. 
Those three workshops have been adapted into "episodes" here.
