                        <summary>Gospel Book, produced for Otto III between 996-1002, possibly by
                            the Trier artist known as the 'Master of the Registrum Gregorii'. It
                            seems to have been in Cologne soon after it was completed and influenced
                            the decoration of a number of manuscripts executed there in the early
                            11th century, which provide a good idea of the miniatures it now
                            lacks.</summary>

                                <p>This manuscript is now generally assigned to the outstanding
                                    Trier artist of the Ottonian period known as the &apos;Master of
                                    the Registrum Gregorii&apos;. Brigitte Nitschke has doubted this
                                    (see her Die Handschrijtengruppe urn den Meister des Registrum
                                    Gregorii (MÃ¼nstersche Studien zur Kunstgeschichte, Bd.v (1966)),
                                    particularly pp. 72-74, 81). For a detailed discussion of the
                                    whole matter see Peter Bloch and Hermann Schnitzler, Die
                                    ottonische KÃ¶lner Malerschule, 2 vols. (DÃ¼sseldorf, 1970) and
                                    the references there, particularly the notes in Bd.II, pp. 15,
                                    17-21. Bloch and Schnitzler devote a whole section to this
                                    manuscript under the heading &apos;Das Evangeliar des Trierer
                                    Gregormeisters in Manchester, John Rylands Library Cod. 98&apos;
                                    (Bd. II, pp. 15-21) giving (a) a full collation (II.16-17), (b)
                                    a reconstruction of its imperfections from the Stuttgart Gospels
                                    (Landesbibliothek MS. Bibl. f. 21), a MS. which was copied from
                                    it (II.15), (c) notes on its provenance (II.17), localisation
                                    and dating (II.17-19) and style (II.19-20), and (d) an account
                                    of its significance (II.20-21). They date it, &apos;with great
                                    probability&apos;, to between 996 and 1002. It apparently found
                                    its way to Cologne soon after it was completed and influenced
                                    the decoration of a number of manucsripts executed there in the
                                    early 11th century. From these we may obtain a good idea of the
                                    miniatures it now lacks.</p></decoNote>

                                    shoulder. The mantle is twice pink and twice green, over white.
                                    Each medallion is edged with a red line dotted with white. The
