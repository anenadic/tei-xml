title: "Instructor Notes"
---

These episodes are designed to run over serveral weeks as follows:

1. "Introduction to TEI" which sets the scene and includes some "homework" activities.
2. "Elements and Attributes" starts by discussing the previous "homework", covers more content then sets more "homework".
3. "Descriptions and Cataloguing" starts by discussing the previous "homework", covers more content then sets more "homework".

This format provides the following benefits:

- It allows the instructors to assess the learning outcomes from the previous episode.
- It offers collaborative learning by completing the homework in groups, using online communication tools if desired.
- It allows practice time, more for those who need more, and fits around the demanding schedules of staff who may be
timetabled with other committments.

The format has been successfully applied in at least two instances, once with TEI, once with Datastream. (Details to follow.) FIXME
