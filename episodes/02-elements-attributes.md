Building on first workshop, getting stuck in to manuscript description.

We will work together at the start, working on paper. When we get to Oxygen, you may work at your own pace.

# Discuss homework from previous exercise

> ## Activity: marking up
> 
> Here is some information from Latin MS 6 to be entered into elements in TEI. 
> Enter the correct information from here into the corresponding TEI elements.
>
> - Latin MS 6 
> - Petrus Lombardus super Psalmos 
> - Parchment 
> - Page height and width 355 x 240mm 
> - 197 folios
> - Double columns of 48 lines
> - 12th century
> - Written in Germany
> - i8 ii8 (wants 1) iii-xxiv8 xxv4, xxvi2
> - The front cover is plated with gilt metal, apparently, of 13th century. 
> It is thus arranged. The border is composed of six oblong plates of enamel (at the corners and in the middle of the sides) 
> bearing decorative designs: 
> the intervals between these are occupied by six longer strips of filagree work, each of which is set with four stones. 
> The central plate of gilt metal has an incised design of foliage partially surrounding a crucifix. 
> The figure on the cross is in relief, crowned, with loin-cloth, and is fastened by four nails. 
> The cross is set with small turquoises. The head (bearded) inclines to left. The title of the cross bears the letters IHS: 
> above it is the Divine Hand. The interior angles of the cross are filled in, so that there is a disk at the intersection. 
> The field or body of the cross is enamelled. At each extremity are two stones; two more are on the right of the lower part of the cross, 
> and one is opposite to them on left. Nail holes (seven in number) are in various parts of the field. 
> At the angles of the panel are four disks of enamelled metal, bearing decorative designs. 
> The second cover is of wood, covered with green-brown velvet. 
> It can hardly be supposed that the metal plate originally belonged to the manuscript now associated with it. 
> There is some doubt as to whether the binding originally belonged originally to this MS
> - From the Cistercian Abbey of Hunnerode
> - Bought by Lord Lindsay in October 1861 from the London bookseller Thomas Boone of New Bond St. for Â£80
>
> We will use the following elements and colours:
> - `<msContents>` (intellectual content): blue
> - `<physDesc>` (physical description): red
> - `<history>` (history of the manuscript): green
