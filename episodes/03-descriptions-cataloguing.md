### Loci (or locuses?)
A locus marks information of interest on a particular page. In MDC, this links directly to the correct image (demonstrate)

- Illustrations
- Annotations
- Physical evidence

MDC enables a live link between the description and the relevant image


> ## Activity: How do you mark up a locus?
> 
> - Navigate to MDC www.digitalcollections.manchester.ac.uk
> - Find Latin MS 8 (Beatus) in the Latin Manuscripts Collection
